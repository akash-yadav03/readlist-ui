# Book Status Tracker

A simple web application built with **Flask (backend)** and **React (frontend)** that allows users to track the status of books they are reading.

This app **does not provide books or book content**.  
It only tracks the reading status based on user interaction.

## Features

- Track books with three statuses:
  - 📘 **Want to Read**
  - 📖 **Ongoing**
  - ✅ **Completed**
- Update book status by clicking buttons in the web app
- Simple and intuitive UI
- REST API built with Flask
- Frontend built with React

---

## How It Works

1. User login by signup 
2. Users search a book title.(currently have a very limited title will add more it to the future.)
3. Each book has buttons to update its status:
   - Want to
   - Ongoing
   - Complete
4. When a button is clicked, the status is updated and stored via the backend.
5. The app only tracks **status**, not book files, summaries, or content.
